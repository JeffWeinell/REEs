- Arbor didn't provide a target coverage table for the final set of probes, but I calculated this myself and the results are in the file SnakeCap_probes_target-coverage.txt


"...  About our ultra-stringent filtration: a probe is eliminated from consideration if it is 25% RepeatMasked, or if its closest *Thamnophis* genomic hit is 25% or more soft-masked, or if the probe has multiple strong hybrid sites detected in the *Thamnophis* genome. To loosen the stringency we could increase the RM threshold and/or the number of tolerable hot hits in the genome. But I would strongly recommend you go with ultra-stringent if it hits sufficient target space for your application." - Arbor
