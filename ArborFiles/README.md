## Files provided by Arbor Biosciences:

**Version 1* targets and baits (not the final set; 120nt baits):
- **Target-Loci_Jeff-Weinell_10Sep2018.fasta**: First set of proposed target loci submitted to Arbor (corresponding to WeinellEntry1â€“1898)
- **WEINELL-ultrastringent-baits-180919je.fas.gz**: Baits designed from version 1 targets
- **WEINELL-ultrastringent-baitcoverage-180919je.txt.gz**: bait coverage statistics

**Version 2** targets and baits (not the final set; 120nt baits):

- **ALLWEINELL-ultrastringent-baits-180925je.fas.gz**
- **ALLWEINELL-ultrastringent-baits-180925je.fas.list.targcovg.table.gz**

**Version 3** probes (the probes we actually ordered; 120nt):
- **ADD2WEINELL-ultrastringent-baits-181005je.fas.gz**
- Arbor didn't provide a target coverage table for the final set of probes, but I calculated this myself and the results are in the file **SnakeCap_probes_target-coverage.txt**

"...  About our ultra-stringent filtration: a probe is eliminated from consideration if it is 25% RepeatMasked, or if its closest *Thamnophis* genomic hit is 25% or more soft-masked, or if the probe has multiple strong hybrid sites detected in the *Thamnophis* genome. To loosen the stringency we could increase the RM threshold and/or the number of tolerable hot hits in the genome. But I would strongly recommend you go with ultra-stringent if it hits sufficient target space for your application." - Arbor
