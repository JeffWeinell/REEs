# notes
I used blastn to search for 149 vision loci (Schott et al., 2017) in *Ophiophagus hannah*, and found a match for 148 of these.

Of the 148 matches, I initially requested probes for 132 of these loci, and 13 of these failed (0% bait coverage), and so these were removed from the probe set.

Probes were designed for the remaining 119 vision loci.

Schott et al. (2017) loci not targeted (n=30):
Locus | Reason not included
----- | -----
ACTB | 0% bait coverage
Amelogenin | 
ARRB2 | 0% bait coverage
CD36 | not yet clear why, because bait coverage was 100%
GART | 0% bait coverage
GAS6 | 0% bait coverage
GPR98 | 
GRK7 | 0% bait coverage
HNF1A | 
HNRPD | 
HOXB5 | 0% bait coverage
MAFB | 74.5% bait coverage, so probably a different reason for exclusion
NACA | 
OPN5 | 
NGF | not yet clear why, because bait coverage was 100%
NONO | 
OPN4 | 
OTX2 | 0% bait coverage
PAXIP1 | 
PDCH15 | not yet clear why, because bait coverage was 100%
POLA1 | 
RHOC | 
RPL22 | 
RPL38 | 
TRB2 | 
UBC | 74.5% bait coverage, so probably a different reason for exclusion
