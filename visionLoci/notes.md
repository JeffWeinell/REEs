I used blastn to search for 149 vision loci (Schott et al., 2017) in Ophiophagus hannah, and found a match for 148 of these.
Of the 148 matches, I initially requested probes for 132 of these loci, and 13 of these failed (0% bait coverage), and so these were removed from the probe set.
Probes were designed for the remaining 119 vision loci.
