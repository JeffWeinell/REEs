# notes
I used blastn to search for 149 vision loci (149 exons of 142 genes; Schott et al., 2017) in *Ophiophagus hannah*, and found a match for 148 of these. The only locus not found in *Ophiophagus* was UNC119, but this was found in *Python*, and therefore probes were designed from *Python* for this gene.

I initially requested probes for 132 of the 149 loci (131 of 142 genes), and probes could not be designed for 13 of these (0% bait coverage).

Probes were designed for the remaining 119 vision loci (118 genes).
