align.alignment.columns

align.and.concatenate.best.exons
                        Align and Concatenate REEs Takes as input a set
                        of exomes and an input table indicating which
                        loci are the REEs, performs multiple sequence
                        alignment (using mafft) for each REE, and
                        outputs: (1) An alignments for each REE locus,
                        (2) The concatenated alignment of REE loci, (3)
                        The partition file associated with the
                        concatenated locus alignment. This function is
                        superceded by makeStatsTable.
align.shared.loci       Align Shared Loci Takes as input a set of fasta
                        sequence files, one per species (or
                        individual). Perfoms multiple sequence
                        alignment (using MAFFT) for loci that are
                        shared among all species (determined by
                        sequence names). Returns a list of DNAStringSet
                        objects, each of which holds aligned sequences
                        for a locus. Optionally writes alignments in
                        fasta format (one alignment per file).
alignment.stats         Get Alignment Stats Table Similar to the
                        function makeExomeStatsTable, except this
                        function takes as input the set of exon
                        alignments rather than the unaligned exomes.
                        The output is an abbreviated version of the
                        stats table produce by the function
                        makeExomeStatsTable. This function is
                        superceded by makeStatsTable have been
                        abandoned. Note that pis.new is used here
                        rather than the pis function that was used in
                        makeExomeStatsTable function.

get.UCEs.from.blastTable
                        Get UCEs From BLAST Table Extracts the
                        sequences defined in an input table (a blast
                        table with NCBI format 6) from an input genome.
                        The input genome should be the same genome used
                        as the subject in the blast table. If the query
                        sequences in the blast table correspond to
                        Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs), then the output
                        is the UCEs of the species with input genome.
                        The quality of the output UCE dataset depends
                        on the quality/completeness of the blast

                        The input genome should be the same genome used
                        as the subject in the blast table. The
                        quality/completeness of the output sequence
                        dataset depends on the quality/completeness of
                        the blast search. The functions
                        get.exome.from.blastTable and
                        get.UCEs.from.blastTable are the same as this
                        one, but applied to a specific type of
                        sequences in the blast table. This function

                        upper limits of each range, respectively.

                        to identify/select the REEs. This function
                        should be used instead of running the functions
