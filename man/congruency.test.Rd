\title{Congruency Test}
\usage{
congruency.test(tree1, tree2, min.support = 80)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree1}{First input tree. Should be class Phylo or multiPhylo.}

\item{tree2}{Second input tree. Should be class Phylo or multiPhylo.}

\item{min.support}{Threshold for a node to be considered strongly supported. Nodes with support less than this value are collapsed into a polytomy. Default is 80, but care should be taken for this value.}
}
\value{
Logical, TRUE if the two trees are congruent, and otherwise FALSE
}
\description{
Pairwise comparison of two input trees testing if their topologies are congruent at highly supported nodes.
}
